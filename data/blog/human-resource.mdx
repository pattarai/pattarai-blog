# Human Resource

"You cannot mandate productivity; you must provide the tools to let people become their best."

The Human Resources at Pattarai is the voice of all things work, workers, and the workplace. We have been elevating the club by driving workplace policy changes, fostering solidarity among the crew, handling review audits, activity monitoring, and recruiting people.

Other activities include coordinating internships, mentorship, ambassadors, and maintaining Pattarai’s League, an evaluating framework to track the crew activity and their contributions. We also provide manpower to committees and projects as we onboard. We managed the operations of the crew using google platforms, milanote, and discord.

One of our new initiatives include Pattarai's Framework, a manual guide to help you understand our workflows and We HR love to automate things since we grew in a tech community where we worked on appreciation card automation and league embeds to know your rank position in discord.

Altogether we ultimately grind for motivitating and yielding benefits together as a crew.
