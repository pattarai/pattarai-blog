With Pattarai growing as a promising tech and learning community, we have many boot camps and learning sessions that happen on a regular basis. So to host and attend these sessions, we built our very own streaming platform, “Project Helix”

People conducting the learning sessions will have access to all the administrative features. The attendees will have the roles to view and interact with their instructor. We also have our recent broadcasts and previously conducted workshops as well as other activities as a playlist for viewers’ convenience.

Learning sessions that are conducted are live-streamed along with host and attendees interaction- that’s our unique proposition. People can enroll themselves for any workshop or any learning sessions held in Helix. HELIX’s second phase will have upgrades that include a new dashboard, user account management, cool blogs, badges, etc. Live streaming feature will have more user-interaction add-ons. People can clarify doubts using threads and discussion forums.

## The online platform will be integrated with Pattarai's hands-on workshops, self-paced guided projects, expert-led training, and various courses on different disciplines.

Users can sign up for any courses/workshops to learn various topics and also gain professional certifications on the completion.

The hosts who conduct the workshops/bootcamps will give tasks at the end of the series of sessions, which the attendees can complete and receive certificates along with a level-up badge. Helix will speed up the learning process where people can find all the resources in one place.
