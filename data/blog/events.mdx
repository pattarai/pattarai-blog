Expecting a challenge and facing different curveballs was the exact reason why I joined the events committee. The events in Pattarai involved a lot of outsourcing, fun and learning! It also required spontaneity and persistence to deal with different situations in both planning and managing. We also learned how to make posters with Adobe software and how to create websites! Sounds cool right?

Like Spotify, here's your Phase 3 Events Wrapped for Pattarai !

Ideathon was the first major event that helped me recognize the organizing and managing skills that I had. It was surely a mountain for me, as this was my first inter-college event.
We wanted to share our collective technical insights and give the freshers a glimpse into our platform and get them on-board. Mentees Conclave broke ground on 15 December 2020. We started with 44 Mentees and 21 Senior students taking the role as Mentors. The mentees sharpened their technical skills with the various tasks given by their mentors covering all basic spheres of engineering.

The event was perfectly timed as our club was nearing its first year anniversary. Our team started working on the posters and did a good job of advertising the event by not only orating to every class in LICET but also by promoting it in international communities and websites. I was excited and ready for May 8th, the day of the competition. We were surprised to see small kids right from the age of 5 to pre-teens participate with so much enthusiasm.I'm pleased to say that we got participants from all corners of India. I was immensely happy to see our events team working together and pulling off an Ideation event online. The only huge task we had was selecting teams out of 500 participants.

To showcase skills and make everyone feel a truly surreal experience, PATTARAI LICET conducted a two-day symposium that was open for all, that transformed into a fantasy that burst forth with cut-throat vibes! This event had technical and non-technical contests amalgamated into nine significant events.

At this venture, we wanted our main motive of learning to be open for all, and we introduced Learnzeit, an open platform to share knowledge and thoughts on various growing and trending engineering topics. The projects and Committees work on a regular basis to give creative and innovative content for the Learnzeit sessions based on what they learn through Pattarai.

As a part of workshops, we conducted the React JS Workshop which focused on basic web development techniques and creating a web application using React JS, a Design Bootcamp spanned across three different parts Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and XD, and an IoT Workshop exploring the working of APIs with the help of Microcontrollers using Micropython.

Hacktoberfest is a widely popular event with around 1.3 billion participation from around 135 countries and over 60 companies encouraging in giving back to the open-source community. We Team Pattarai decided to collaborate with the Hacktoberfest event by conducting a webinar on FastAI and PyTorch, best of Open source and its uses, Github application and how one can contribute to the FastAI notebooks on the PATTARAI’S github platform! There were about 70 which included both school and college students.

On the whole, it was a great experience to organize events and to collaborate with different organizations and universities in India which made the events a huge success.

It was so much fun to work with a group of extremely fun individuals who were so creative and spontaneous Big shoutout to the entire committee for their efforts!
